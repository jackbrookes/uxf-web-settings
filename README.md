# UXF Web Settings

This is a Unity package that provides an alternative way to start a UXF Session. It can download a settings file from a public URL - allowing researching to remotely modify experiment settings to builds of experiments deployed outside the lab.

## Setup

Add the `[UXF_Web_Settings]` prefab to your scene and add the reference to an instance of the `[UXF_Core]` prefab in your scene. See the example scene.

## UI

This package includes a UI similar to the default UXF UI but designed for end-users rather than researchers. Feel free to delete the UI and replace with one you feel appropriate for your project.
